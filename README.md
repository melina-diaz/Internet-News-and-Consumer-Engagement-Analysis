# Internet-News-and-Consumer-Engagement-Analysis

This was part of a data analysis competition on DataCamp. The guidelines and judging criteria for the competition are [here!](https://github.com/melina-diaz/Internet-News-and-Consumer-Engagement-Analysis/blob/main/Instructions.ipynb)

My [initial analysis](https://github.com/melina-diaz/Internet-News-and-Consumer-Engagement-Analysis/blob/main/Analysis-1st-Try.ipynb) was my submission for the competition and the first time I used kMeans. Although my kMeans clustering was successful, I think there is room for improvement. Specifically, I want to add words like "say" and "will" to the list of stop words (words like "the", "and", and "some") because they don't add any significance to the clustering. I also want to find a better way to define the value of k.
