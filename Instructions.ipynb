    "This dataset ([source](https://www.kaggle.com/szymonjanowski/internet-articles-data-with-users-engagement)) consists of data about news articles collected from Sept. 3, 2019 until Nov. 4, 2019. Afterwards, it is enriched by Facebook engagement data, such as number of shares, comments and reactions. It was first created to predict the popularity of an article before it was published. However, there is a lot more you can analyze; take a look at some suggestions at the end of this template."
